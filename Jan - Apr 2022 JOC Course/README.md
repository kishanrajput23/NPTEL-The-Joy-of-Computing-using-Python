🔶 In Proctored / Center Based Examaination you will be getting only **Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)** with total 50 questions and The total duration of the examination is 180 minutes⏰.

🔶 The questions will be divided into 3 sections i,e, A, B, C respectively where,

2️⃣ Here is one trivia for all of you if you solved all the weekly quizzes then there is high probability that some questions will directly come from weekly quizzes that means **100% Copy Paste.**

3️⃣ There is also high chances of some questions that will directly come from weekly quizzes but, in that questions you will be getting different values or data.
